        Flinc is the leading ridesharing service in Germany. Backed by BMW and Deutsche Bahn, Flinc has a growing network of drivers and passengers.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        The Flinc service automatically matches passengers to the best drivers based on intelligent routing with a goal of getting you door-to-door with the help of a friendly driver.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        For drivers, Flinc handles pricing proposals so as to take away awkward negotiation between driver and passenger.
      </p>
      <br/>
			<h6 class="info_section_title">The Project</h6>
      <p>
        Our connection with Flinc came through a member of their Android team, with whom we worked on a previous project. Tight deadlines and a critical release meant they needed help to get through their backlog.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        We were able to drop straight into their mobile development team and get to work building key features for the upcoming release.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        In contrast to projects where we represent the entire mobile development team, this engagement is a good example of how we also like to come in and be part of an existing team to lend a hand where needed.
